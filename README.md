# Laser Defender 2D

## Description
Laser Defender 2D is a simple space shooter game developed using Unity. It features basic mechanics like player movement, shooting projectiles, and an enemy spawner. The goal of the game is to defend against waves of enemies while avoiding damage. This project is part of my internship application, and while it currently includes basic gameplay, I plan to add more features and polish it further in the future.

## Features
- Player movement and shooting
- Enemy spawner (basic)
- Projectile system (shoot bullets)
- Score tracking (basic)
